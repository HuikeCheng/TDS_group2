  abstract = {The complete blood cell (CBC) count is an inexpensive, frequently obtained blood test whose information content is potentially underused. We examined the predictive ability of the CBC count for incident death in 29,526 consecutive consenting patients who underwent coronary angiography. Subjects were randomly assigned to training (60\%) and test (40\%) groups and were followed for an average of 4.9 years. Computed and integer risk score models for all-cause death were developed for 30 days and 1, 5, and 10 years using multivariable logistic regressions applied to CBC metrics, age, and gender. The study cohort was an average age of 61 years, 62\% were men, and had a 3.3\% annual risk of mortality. An integer (scalar) risk score (range 0 to 18) successfully separated patient cohorts into subgroups at markedly different mortality risks ({$<$}1\% to {$>$}14\% at 30 days). Predictive fractions (area under risk curve) at 30 days for the CBC-only model and the age- and gender-adjusted CBC model were 0.76 and 0.78, respectively, in the training set and 0.71 and 0.75, respectively, in the test set (all p values {$<<$}0.001). The CBC model was markedly more informative than models based only on hematocrit, white blood cell count, or age and gender and was superior to models with all 7 traditional risk factors. In conclusion, in a large, prospectively assembled database, a CBC risk model had high predictive ability for risk of incident mortality. A total CBC score is an important new addition to risk prediction, and it can be easily generated by computer for clinical use at negligible incremental cost.},

Therefore, there is a clear need for a revision to the current classification. The revisions to the categories of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia will be published in a monograph in 2016 and reflect a consensus of opinion of hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and geneticists. The 2016 edition represents a revision of the prior classification rather than an entirely new classification and attempts to incorporate new clinical, prognostic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data that have emerged since the last edition.

To explore potential biological embedding and the consequences of SEP experiences from early life to adulthood, we investigate how SEP indicators at different points across the life course may be related to a combination of 28 inflammation markers. Using blood-derived inflammation profiles measured by a multiplex array in 268 participants from the Italian component of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, we evaluate the association between early life, young adulthood and later adulthood SEP with each inflammatory markers separately, or by combining them into an inflammatory score. We identified an increased inflammatory burden in participants whose father had a manual occupation, through increased plasma levels of CSF3 (G-CSF; {$\beta$}\,=\,0.29; P\,=\,0.002), and an increased inflammatory score ({$\beta$}\,=\,1.96; P\,=\,0.029). Social mobility was subsequently modelled by the interaction between father's occupation and the highest household occupation, revealing a significant difference between "stable Non-manual" profiles over the life course versus "Manual to Non-manual" profiles ({$\beta$}\,=\,2.38, P\,=\,0.023). Low SEP in childhood is associated with modest increase in adult inflammatory burden; however, the analysis of social mobility suggests a stronger effect of an upward social mobility over the life course.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Gene selection algorithms for cancer classification, based on the expression of a small number of biomarker genes, have been the subject of considerable research in recent years. Shevade and Keerthi propose a gene selection algorithm based on sparse logistic regression (SLogReg) incorporating a Laplace prior to promote sparsity in the model parameters, and provide a simple but efficient training procedure. The degree of sparsity obtained is determined by the value of a regularization parameter, which must be carefully tuned in order to optimize performance. This normally involves a model selection stage, based on a computationally intensive search for the minimizer of the cross-validation error. In this paper, we demonstrate that a simple Bayesian approach can be taken to eliminate this regularization parameter entirely, by integrating it out analytically using an uninformative Jeffrey's prior. The improved algorithm (BLogReg) is then typically two or three orders of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, as there is no longer a need for a model selection step. The BLogReg algorithm is also free from selection bias in performance estimation, a common pitfall in the application of machine learning algorithms in cancer classification.Results: The SLogReg, BLogReg and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) gene selection algorithms are evaluated over the well-studied colon cancer and leukaemia benchmark datasets. The leave-one-out estimates of the probability of test error and cross-entropy of the BLogReg and SLogReg algorithms are very similar, however the BlogReg algorithm is found to be considerably faster than the original SLogReg algorithm. Using nested cross-validation to avoid selection bias, performance estimation for SLogReg on the leukaemia dataset takes almost 48 h, whereas the corresponding result for BLogReg is obtained in only 1 min 24 s, making BLogReg by far the more practical algorithm. BLogReg also demonstrates better estimates of conditional probability than the RVM, which are of great importance in medical applications, with similar computational expense.Availability: A MATLAB implementation of the sparse logistic regression algorithm with Bayesian regularization (BLogReg) is available from Contact: ~gcc@cmp.uea.ac.uk},

Two main groups of MPN, BCR::ABL1-positive (Chronic Myeloid Leukemia) and BCR::ABL1-negative (Polycythemia Vera, Essential Thrombocytosis, Primary Myelofibrosis) are distinguished. For many years, cytomorphologic and histologic features were the only proof of MPN and attempted to distinguish the different entities of the subgroup BCR::ABL1-negative MPN. World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid neoplasms evolves over the years and increasingly considers molecular abnormalities to prove the clonal hematopoiesis. In addition to morphological clues, the detection of JAK2, MPL and CALR mutations are considered driver events belonging to the major diagnostic criteria of BCR::ABL1-negative MPN. This highlights the preponderant place of molecular features in the MPN diagnosis. Moreover, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allowed the identification of additional somatic mutations involved in clonal hematopoiesis and playing a role in the prognosis of MPN. Nowadays, careful cytomorphology and molecular biology are inseparable and complementary to provide a specific diagnosis and to permit the best follow-up of these diseases.},

  abstract = {With rapid advances in sequencing technologies, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), thus revealing enormous genetic and clonal heterogeneity, and paving the way for precision medicine approaches. The successful development of precision medicine for patients with AML has been exemplified by the introduction of targeted FLT3, IDH1/IDH2 and BCL-2 inhibitors. When used as single agents, these inhibitors display moderate antileukaemic activity. However, augmented clinical activity has been demonstrated when they are administered in combination with drugs with broader mechanisms of action targeting epigenetic and/or other oncogenic signalling pathways or with conventional cytotoxic agents. The development of immunotherapies has been hampered by the expression of antigens that are expressed by both leukaemic and non-malignant haematopoietic progenitor cells; nonetheless, a diverse range of immunotherapies are now entering clinical development. This myriad of emerging agents also creates challenges, such as how to safely combine agents with different mechanisms of action, the need to circumvent primary and secondary resistance, and new challenges in future clinical trial design. In this Review, we discuss the current state of precision medicine for AML, including both the potential to improve patient outcomes and the related challenges.},

We conducted experiments in our blood test dataset using three different data mining techniques which are association rules, rule induction and deep learning. The goal of our experiments is to generate models that can distinguish patients with normal blood disease from patients who have blood tumor. We evaluated our results using different metrics applied on real data collected from Gaza European hospital in Palestine. The final results showed that association rules could give us the relationship between blood test characteristics and blood tumor. Also, it demonstrated that deep learning classifiers has the best ability to predict tumor types of blood diseases with an accuracy of 79.45\%. Also, rule induction gave us an explanation of rules that describes both tumor in blood and normal hematology.},

The genomic characterization of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms offers the potential for personalized diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment. METHODS: We sequenced coding exons from 69 myeloid cancer genes in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms, comprehensively annotating driver mutations and copy-number changes. We developed a genomic classification for myeloproliferative neoplasms and multistage prognostic models for predicting outcomes in individual patients. Classification and prognostic models were validated in an external cohort. RESULTS: A total of 2035 patients were included in the analysis. A total of 33 genes had driver mutations in at least 5 patients, with mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL being the sole abnormality in 45\% of the patients. The numbers of driver mutations increased with age and advanced disease. Driver mutations, germline polymorphisms, and demographic variables independently predicted whether patients received a diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia as compared with polycythemia vera or a diagnosis of chronic-phase disease as compared with myelofibrosis. We defined eight genomic subgroups that showed distinct clinical phenotypes, including blood counts, risk of leukemic transformation, and event-free survival. Integrating 63 clinical and genomic variables, we created prognostic models capable of generating personally tailored predictions of clinical outcomes in patients with chronic-phase myeloproliferative neoplasms and myelofibrosis. The predicted and observed outcomes correlated well in internal cross-validation of a training cohort and in an independent external cohort. Even within individual categories of existing prognostic schemas, our models substantially improved predictive accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive genomic characterization identified distinct genetic subgroups and provided a classification of myeloproliferative neoplasms on the basis of causal biologic mechanisms. Integration of genomic data with clinical variables enabled the personalized predictions of patients' outcomes and may support the treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Overall, 334 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and 101 patients with benign ovarian tumors were randomly assigned to "training" and "test" cohorts. Seven supervised machine learning classifiers, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine, Random Forest (RF), Conditional RF (CRF), Na\"ive Bayes, Neural Network, and Elastic Net, were used to derive diagnostic and prognostic information from 32 parameters commonly available from pretreatment peripheral blood tests and age. RESULTS: Machine learning techniques were superior to conventional regression-based analyses in predicting multiple clinical parameters pertaining to EOC. Ensemble methods combining weak decision trees, such as GBM, RF, and CRF, showed the best performance in EOC prediction. The values for the highest accuracy and area under the ROC curve (AUC) for segregating EOC from benign ovarian tumors with RF were 92.4\% and 0.968, respectively. The highest accuracy and AUC for predicting clinical stages with RF were 69.0\% and 0.760, respectively. High-grade serous and mucinous histotypes of EOC could be preoperatively predicted with RF. An ordinal RF classifier could distinguish complete resection from others. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified subgroups among early-stage EOC patients with significantly worse survival. CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning systems can provide critical diagnostic and prognostic prediction for patients with EOC before initial intervention, and the use of predictive algorithms may facilitate personalized treatment options through pretreatment stratification of patients.},

Clinical presentation, genetic landscape, outcomes, and best management practices are inadequately described in this group. Over the past decade, more research has focused on younger patients, and this paper seeks to review and describe the current status of the field. RECENT FINDINGS: A recent review analyzed the available pediatric MPN literature and highlighted the paucity of published data. Pediatric patients showed lower rates of the common mutations found in adults, thrombotic events, and disease transformation to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia. A number of centers have recently shared their experience with young adult patients. Better survival outcomes were confirmed for young adult patients compared to older patients. There is still much to learn about myeloproliferative neoplasms in pediatric and young adult patients, but currently available data showing better outcomes is reassuring.},

However, few studies have tried to identify DNA methylation markers to diagnose diverse cancer types simultaneously, i.e., pan-cancers. In this study, we tried to identify DNA methylation markers to differentiate cancer samples from the respective normal samples in pan-cancers. We collected whole genome methylation data of 27 cancer types containing 10,140 cancer samples and 3386 normal samples, and divided all samples into five data sets, including one training data set, one validation data set and three test data sets. We applied machine learning to identify DNA methylation markers, and specifically, we constructed diagnostic prediction models by deep learning. We identified two categories of markers: 12 CpG markers and 13 promoter markers. Three of 12 CpG markers and four of 13 promoter markers locate at cancer-related genes. With the CpG markers, our model achieved an average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets as 92.8\% and 90.1\%, respectively. For promoter markers, the average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets were 89.8\% and 81.1\%, respectively. Furthermore, in cell-free DNA methylation data of 163 prostate cancer samples, the CpG markers achieved the sensitivity as 100\%, and the promoter markers achieved 92\%. For both marker types, the specificity of normal whole blood was 100\%. To conclude, we identified methylation markers to diagnose pan-cancers, which might be applied to liquid biopsy of cancers.},

Most artificial intelligence products with application in healthcare are associated with machine learning, i.e., a field of informatics and statistics dealing with the generation of predictive or descriptive models through data-based learning, rather than programming of strict rules. Machine learning has been widely used in pathomorphology, radiology, genomics, and electronic medical record data analysis. In line with the current trend, artificial intelligence technologies will most likely become increasingly integrated into health research and practice, including hematology. Thus, artificial intelligence and machine learning call for attention and understanding on the part of researchers and clinical physicians. The present review covers important terms and basic concepts of these technologies, as well as offers examples of their actual use in hematological research and practice.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop an ovarian cancer-specific predictive framework for clinical use platinum-sensitivity and prognosis using machine learning methods based on multiple biomarkers, including circulating tumor cells (CTCs). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 156 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients, randomly assigned into the training and validation cohorts. Eight machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting Machine, Conditional RF, Neural Network, Naive Bayes, Elastic Net, and Logistic Regression, were used to derive predictive information from 11 peripheral blood parameters, including CTCs. Through the advanced CanPatrol CTC-enrichment technique, we detect CTCs and classify them into subpopulations: epithelial, mesenchymal, and hybrids. Survival curves were generated by Kaplan-Meier method and calculated through the Log rank test. RESULTS: Machine learning techniques, especially the Random Forest classifier, were superior to conventional regression-based analyses in predicting multiple clinical parameters related to EOC. The values for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for segregating EOC with advanced clinical stages and platinum-sensitivity were 0.796 (95\% CI, 0.727-0.866) and 0.809 (95\% CI, 0.742-0.876), respectively. Stepwise, we used the unsupervised clustering analysis to identify EOC subgroups with significantly worse overall survival (OS), especially in the advanced-stage group with the p-value of 0.0018 (HR, 2.716; 95\% CI, 1.602-4.605) for progression-free survival (PFS) and 0.0037 (HR, 2.359; 95\% CI, 1.752-6.390) for overall survival (OS). CONCLUSION: Machine learning systems could provide risk stratification for EOC patients before initial intervention through blood variables, including circulating tumor cells. The predictive algorithms could facilitate personalized treatment options through promising pre-treatment stratification of EOC patients.

  abstract = {Myelofibrosis (MF) is a BCR-ABL1- myeloproliferative neoplasm that arises from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells frequently harboring a somatic driver mutation in 1 of 3 genes: JAK2, CALR, or MPL. The pathologic features of this hematologic malignancy include myeloproliferation, diffuse bone marrow fibrosis, and overactivation of the JAK-STAT pathway, resulting in enhanced inflammatory cytokine release. The common clinical manifestations of MF include systemic symptoms, abnormal peripheral blood count levels, and splenomegaly. However, it has become increasingly appreciated that significant clinical heterogeneity exists among patients with MF. Two distinct MF clinical phenotypes include the myeloproliferative and myelodepletive phenotype, with peripheral blood counts being the main discerning feature. Patients with the myeloproliferative phenotype will present with elevated peripheral blood counts and often experience significant constitutional symptoms and progressive splenomegaly. In contrast, patients with the myelodepletive phenotype will have low peripheral blood counts and will frequently require transfusion support. Current frontline therapies for MF, include ruxolitinib and fedratinib, which can exacerbate cytopenias and thereby pose an impediment to effective treatment of the myelodepletive patient. The present review discusses the clinical and prognostic implications of the myelodepletive phenotype and the therapeutic options and limitations for this subset of patients, representing an unmet clinical need.},

The discovery of mutations in JAK2 over a decade ago heralded a new age for patient care as a consequence of improved diagnosis and the development of therapeutic JAK inhibitors. The more recent identification of mutations in calreticulin brought with it a sense of completeness, with most patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm now having a biological basis for their excessive myeloproliferation. We are also beginning to understand the processes that lead to acquisition of somatic mutations and the factors that influence subsequent clonal expansion and emergence of disease. Extended genomic profiling has established a multitude of additional acquired mutations, particularly prevalent in myelofibrosis, where their presence carries prognostic implications. A major goal is to integrate genetic, clinical, and laboratory features to identify patients who share disease biology and clinical outcome, such that therapies, both existing and novel, can be better targeted.},

Using a strict selection criterion, utilizing MeSH terminology and Boolean logic, an electronic search of MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore Digital Library was performed. The electronic search was complemented by handsearching of references of related studies and the top results of Google Scholar. The full texts of 58 articles were reviewed, out of which, 22 studies were included. The number of studies discussing ALL, AML, CLL, and CML was 12, 8, 3, and 1, respectively. No studies were prospectively applying algorithms in real-world scenarios. Majority of studies had small and homogenous samples and used supervised learning for classification tasks. 91\% of the studies were performed after 2010, and 74\% of the included studies applied ML algorithms to microscopic diagnosis of leukemia. The included studies illustrated the need to develop the field of ML research, including the transformation from solely designing algorithms to practically applying them clinically.},

We used multivariate Cox regression models with adjustments for age, smoking, sex, and place of residence. Being overweight at baseline was associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer mortality (hazard ratio (HR) =2.22; 95\% CI 1.19-4.17). Obesity at baseline was associated with a higher risk of any cancer mortality [all subjects (1.23 (1.01-1.50)), and females (1.40 (1.07-1.84))]. Chronically obese females (females who were obese during the entire study-period) had a higher risk of mortality from any cancer (2.16 (1.47-3.18), lung (3.22 (1.06-9.76)), colorectal (4.32 (1.53-12.20)), and breast cancer (2.52 (1.15-5.54)).

Both short-term annual increase and decrease in BMI were associated with a lower mortality risk from any cancer [all subjects: (0.67 (0.47-0.94)) and (0.73 (0.55-0.97)), respectively].

We systematically reviewed studies that assessed the association of the FBC and diagnosis of colorectal cancer to identify components as risk factors. We reviewed FBC-based prediction models for colorectal cancer risk. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched until 3 September 2019. We meta-analysed the mean difference in FBC components between those with and without a diagnosis and critically appraised the development and validation of FBC-based prediction models. Results: We included 53 eligible articles. Three of four meta-analysed components showed an association with diagnosis. In the remaining 16 with insufficient data for meta-analysis, three were associated with colorectal cancer. Thirteen FBC-based models were developed. Model performance was commonly assessed using the c-statistic (range 0.72\textendash 0.91) and calibration plots. Some models appeared to work well for early detection but good performance may be driven by early events. Conclusion: Red blood cells, haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell distribution width, white blood cell count, and platelets are associated with diagnosis and could be used for referral. Existing FBC-based prediction models might not perform as well as expected and need further critical testing.},

  abstract = {Microscopic examination of peripheral blood plays an important role in the field of diagnosis and control of major diseases. Peripheral leukocyte recognition by manual requires medical technicians to observe blood smears through light microscopy, using their experience and expertise to discriminate and analyze different cells, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and subjective. The traditional systems based on feature engineering often need to ensure successful segmentation and then manually extract certain quantitative and qualitative features for recognition but still remaining a limitation of poor robustness. The classification pipeline based on convolutional neural network is of automatic feature extraction and free of segmentation but hard to deal with multiple object recognition. In this paper, we take leukocyte recognition as object detection task and apply two remarkable object detection approaches, Single Shot Multibox Detector and An Incremental Improvement Version of You Only Look Once. To improve recognition performance, some key factors involving these object detection approaches are explored and the detection models are generated using the train set of 14,700 annotated images. Finally, we evaluate these detection models on test sets consisting of 1,120 annotated images and 7,868 labeled single object images corresponding to 11 categories of peripheral leukocytes, respectively. A best mean average precision of 93.10\% and mean accuracy of 90.09\% are achieved while the inference time is 53 ms per image on a NVIDIA GTX1080Ti GPU.},

  abstract = {Although most small B-cell lymphomas (SBCLs) can be diagnosed using routine methods, challenges exist. For example, marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs) can be difficult to rule-in, in large part because no widely-used, sensitive, and specific biomarker is available for the marginal zone cell of origin. In this study, it was hypothesized that DNA methylation array profiling can assist with the classification of SBCLs, including MZLs. Extramedullary SBCLs, including challenging cases, were reviewed internally for pathology consensus and profiled. By combining the resulting array data set with data sets from other groups, a set of 26 informative probes was selected and used to train machine learning models to classify 4 common SBCLs: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and MZL. Prediction probability cutoff was used to separate classifiable from unclassifiable cases, and show that the trained model was able to classify 95\% of independent test cases (n = 264/279). The concordance between model predictions and pathology diagnoses was 99.6\% (n = 262/263) among classifiable test cases. One validation reference test case was reclassified based on model prediction. The model was also used to predict the diagnoses of two challenging SBCLs. Although the differential examined and data on difficult cases are limited, these results support accurate methylation-based classification of SBCLs. Furthermore, high specificities of predictions suggest that methylation signatures can be used to rule-in MZLs.},

  abstract = {Goals Cell population data (CPD) are new morphologic parameters including volume, conductivity, and five light scattering characteristics used for leukocyte classification by an automated hematology analyzer, the UniCel DxH 800. We developed a discriminating CPD model to predict the leukemia lineage during routine complete blood cell count (CBC). Procedures We analyzed the CPD of 405 blood samples containing more than 10\% blasts that were randomly divided into test and validation sets. With the test set, we produced a model for categorizing acute lymhoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), using ranges of the CPD and regarding the remainder as non-APL acute myeloid leukemia. We verified these models against the validation set. Results In the test set, we formulated a 21-parameter model which identified 43 of 47 ALL cases (91.5\% sensitivity) and ruled out 151 of 156 other leukemia cases (96.8\% specificity), and a 13-parameter model which distinguished all 10 APL cases (100\% sensitivity) and excluded 193 other leukemia cases (100\% specificity). In the validation set, the ALL model showed 85.1\% sensitivity and 94.2\% specificity, and the APL model 100\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity. Conclusions This study demonstrated a new solution for predicting blast lineage using the CPD on a CBC and leukocyte differential.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to platelet ratio (RPR) is a novel inflammatory indicator. It integrates the risk prediction of RDW and platelet, which is associated with adverse outcomes. However, the predictive power of RPR in mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains uncertain. Thus, we aimed to explore the association between RPR and 180-day in-hospital mortality in patients with AMI. METHODS: Data on patients with AMI were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. Patients were divided into two groups according to the optimal RPR cut-off value. The survival curve between high and low RPR groups was plotted via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the association between RPR on admission and 180-day in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1266 patients were enrolled, of which 83 (6.8\%) died within 180 days during the hospitalization. Compared with the survivor group, the non-survivor group had higher RPR on admission (0.11\,{$\pm$}\,0.07 vs. 0.08\,{$\pm$}\,0.06, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The KM curve indicated that the survival probability of low RPR group was higher than that of high RPR group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that higher RPR on admission was an independent and effective predictor of 180-day mortality in patients with AMI (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.677, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.159-6.188, P\,=\,0.021). CONCLUSION: Higher RPR was associated with higher in-hospital 180-day mortality in patients with AMI.},

High pretreatment RDW level is associated with poor survival outcomes in various malignancies, although the results are controversial. We aimed to investigate the prognostic role of RDW. A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE till April 2018. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for overall survival (OS) and combined disease-free survival, progression-free survival, and recurrence-free survival (DFS/PFS/RFS). 49 studies with 19,790 individuals were included in the final analysis. High RDW level adversely affected both OS and DFS/PFS/RFS. For solid cancers, colorectal cancer (CRC) had the strongest relationship with poor OS, followed by hepatic cancer (HCC). Negative OS outcomes were also observed in hematological malignancies. Furthermore, patients at either early or advanced stage had inverse relationship between high pretreatment RDW and poor OS. Studies with cut-off values between 13\% and 14\% had worse HRs for OS and DFS/PFS/RFS than others. Furthermore, region under the curve (ROC) analysis was used widely to define cut-off values and had relatively closer relationship with poorer HRs. In conclusion, our results suggested that elevated pretreatment RDW level could be a negative predictor for cancer prognosis.},

	abstract = {Background
Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a parameter of the standard full blood count tests, measuring the size variability of erythrocytes. Recently, its elevation has been proven to reliably reflect the extent systematic inflammation, mainly in cardiometabolic diseases. Up to date, its association with solid malignancies has been scarcely investigated.

Methods
We performed a retrospective study, in order to examine if RDW values comparing elevation is correlated with the histopathological parameters of breast cancer (tumor size, grade, lymphatic spread, overexpression of hormonal receptors and HER2 protein), as well as to assess the existence of any differences in RDW comparing two age-matched groups of patients with benign and malignant breast lesions respectively.

Results
RDW was significantly higher in patients with breast cancer, when compared to the enrolled patients with fibroadenomas. Moreover, in the breast cancer group, RDW elevation was significantly correlated with larger primary tumors, higher number of infiltrated axillary lymph nodes and HER2 overexpression, while it was inversely associated with the tumor grade.

Conclusions
Our pilot study demonstrated tha Red cell distribution width may be a novel biomarker of the activity of breast cancer. Although our preliminary findings need to be evaluated by studies with larger samples of patients, based on commonly accepted pathophysiological principles, we presume that they will be applicable not only in breast cancer, but also in other types of solid cancers, providing a simple and cost-effective biomarker of cancer surveillance.},

Contrarily, there are relatively few reports focusing on RDW in the area of oncology and to date none review have been performed in this specific field. As such, the aim of this narrative review is to summarize some interesting results obtained in studies performed in patients affected by solid and hematological tumors.

Much previous research has indicated that it increases in cases of systemic inflammation or cardiametabolic incident. However, information on the relation of RDW with solid tumors causing systemic inflammation is limited. In the present research, we examined the relation of RDW with malignant and benign lesions of the colon. Materials and Methods: 115 patients with colon polyps (group 1), and 30 with colon cancer (group 2) who were diagnosed histopathologically in our clinic between January 2010-January 2013 were scanned retrospectively. Patients with anemia, hematologic diseases and active inflammation were excluded. RDW, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hemoglobin (Hgb) and platelet (Plt) measurements were recorded and their relations with the malignant and benign lesions of the colon were examined. Results: Both groups were similar in age and gender distribution. RDW values of patients with colon cancer were significantly higher than the patients with colon polyp (p=0,01). No significant differences were detected between the two groups in terms of MCV and Plt values (p{\textgreater}0,05). Conclusions: RDW can be used as an early warning biomarker for solid colon tumors. Further prospective research is required on the relations of cheap and easily measured RDW parameters with colon malignancies.},
